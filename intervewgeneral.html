        <p class="question">What did you learn yesterday/this week?</p>
        <p class="answer">This one will change pretty often, but at time of
          writing, I'm working on a Javascript game with canvas. Last week, it
          was ejs in Node.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="iq">
        <p class="question">What excites or interests you about coding?</p>
        <p class="answer">What doesn't?! The thing that excites me most, though,
         is being able to type away at the keyboard for a while, and then make
       the computer do something! It's like art and magic. I also love the
       feeling that I get when I finally make something difficult work.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="iq">
        <p class="question">What is a recent technical challenge you experienced
           and how did you solve it?</p>
        <p class="answer">Most recently, I needed to have a database for a
        personal project (EquipInspect.com), and I figured out how to integrate
        nedb into Node, Express, and ejs. I am currently struggling with making
        Node POST data to a Python program, and pupulate an ejs template with
        the returned data (it works on locakhost, but not my server).</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="question">When building a new web site or maintaining one,
          can you explain some techniques you have used to increase performance?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">I haven't really run into this issue yet, although I
        do test alternative methods of solving a problem for speed on occasion,
         and also read about the optimal way to do the same online.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="question">Can you describe some SEO best practices or
          techniques you have used lately?</p>
        <p class="answer">Completely out of my wheelhouse. I'm not so much
        interested in UI/UX as I am in JavaScript and back end. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="question">Can you explain any common techniques or recent
          issues solved in regards to front-end security?</p>
        <p class="answer">I'm not sure it counts as fromt end, but I recently
        discovered and implemented sessions in my Node app.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="question">What actions have you personally taken on recent
          projects to increase maintainability of your code?</p>
        <p class="answer">I learned (from the Coding Blocks podcast) that my
        variable names should be much more descriptive than I had been making
        them, and changed that. I also have been commenting more and organizing
        my code (functions, variables, etc) better.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="question">Talk about your preferred development environment.
        </p>
        <p class="answer">I program primarily in Atom, with
          Platformio-IDE-Terminal on a Debian Stretch desktop with dual
          monitors. I usually just use IDLE for Python programming.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="question">Which version control systems are you familiar with?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">System, singular. I use git (built into Atom).</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="question">Can you describe your workflow when you create a
          web page?</p>
        <p class="answer">I'm still in the process of developing my workflow,
        but currently, I set up a dummy page with colored divs with CSS grid,
        and once I have spacing and media queries roughed out, place some
        content. After testing that a bit, I add in Javascript as necessary.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="question">If you have 5 different stylesheets, how would you
          best integrate them into the site?</p>
        <p class="answer">My understanding of HTML5 is that it is actually much
        faster to call in multiple small resources than one big one now. I'd
        search them for repeated/duplicated items, and call them individually.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="question">Can you describe the difference between progressive
          enhancement and graceful degradation?</p>
        <p class="answer">They're mostly just which way you design. progressive
        enhancement is building off of a base in case features are available,
        and graceful degradation is building will all features, and planning
        what happens if they disappear.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="question">How would you optimize a website's assets/resources?</p>
        <p class="answer">This is a pretty open ended question. I prefer strict
        organization into folders and sub-folders, using images of the minimum
        acceptable file-size, and I'd probably try to compare CSS if there were
        more than one file to make sure nothing is duplicated.</p>
      </div>

      How many resources will a browser download from a given domain at a time?
      What are the exceptions?
      <div>
        <p class="question">Name 3 ways to decrease page load (perceived or
          actual load time).</p>
        <p class="answer">Load the js after the HTML, so that the site is
          visually ready even if the interactivity lags behind. Minimize the use
          of libraries (don't use jQuery if you don't need to, and if you use
          Bootstrap, cut out the parts you don't need). For necessary libraries,
          research and use the most common CDNs (since the user is more likely
          to already have them downloaded). </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="question">If you jumped on a project and they used tabs and
          you used spaces, what would you do?</p>
        <p class="answer">I'd continue to use spaces, then write a Python
         program to scan and change spaces to tabs, and use it before committing
          code.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="question">Describe how you would create a simple slideshow
          page.</p>
        <p class="answer">I'd probably use jQuery for the pretty fade effect. I
        might use Bootstrap. If I were to do it myself (time available), the
        first thing that comes to mind is changing the img src property with
        either setInterval or left and right 'scroll' buttons.</p>

      If you could master one technology this year, what would it be?
      Explain the importance of standards and standards bodies.
      <div>
        <p class="question">What is Flash of Unstyled Content? How do you avoid
          FOUC?</p>
        <p class="answer">FOUC is when the html of the page loads before the css
         is applied to is. There are probably a million ways to avoid it, but I
         would think minimizing the loadtime of your css, or possibly using a
         js promise to display content? </p>

      Explain what ARIA and screenreaders are, and how to make a website accessible.
      Explain some of the pros and cons for CSS animations versus JavaScript animations.
      What does CORS stand for and what issue does it address?
      How did you handle a disagreement with your boss or your collaborator?
      <div>
        <p class="question">What resources do you use to learn about the latest
          in front end development and design?</p>
        <p class="answer">This is a huge answer. I use Udemy, Coursera, EdX,
        FreeCodeCamp, ShopTalkShow and several other podcasts, Google's search
        tools "within the last year" constraint when researching answers, and I
        am subscribed to several e-mailed developer news resources.</p>
